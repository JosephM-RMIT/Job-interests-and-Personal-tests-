# [Ideal Job:](https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/5193015338663936-ai-engineer-google-professional-services/?company=Google&company=YouTube&employment_type=FULL_TIME&hl=en_US&jlo=en_US&q=AI&sort_by=relevance )

The job that I have selected as my ideal job is one within the field of Artificial intelligence. The idea of AI is extremely fascinating to me as the possibilities for applications are endless. It seems like it is the pinnacle technology for humankind to aspire for as once it is created it will completely revolutionise society. This job requires a relevant degree in the field as well as experience working with programming languages, software design, data structures and computing algorithms. Furthermore, it lists ‘preferred qualifications’ such as experience with machine learning systems and knowledge of data warehousing concepts. 

The technical skills I currently possess are not adequate for this job as they are in the field of Client Support and Managed Operating Environment Administration. The listing does, however, mention “Experience working with technical customers and senior management” as well as “Experience working across organisational boundaries”; both of which were part of my previous roles in other companies. I hope to obtain the qualifications for this position through some of my studies at university as well as undertaking post-graduate positions in similar companies dealing with machine learning or deep learning algorithms where the experience will carry over. I plan to slowly build my technical knowledge and industry experience until I am able to obtain my career goals.

# Personality test results:

## Myers-Briggs test
The Myers-Briggs test is designed to categorise people into appropriate groups based on their psychological preferences when perceiving the world around them. It centres around four main questions:

1. **Are you inwardly or outwardly focused?**

2. **How do you prefer to take in information?**

3. **How do you prefer to make decisions?**

4. **How do you prefer to live your outer life?**

Using these four main questions as the keystone, the Myers-Briggs test infers 16 possible personalities.

## Situational Apptitude test


Situtational Apptitude tests focus on evaluating a person based on their ability to make 'correct' desicions based on hypothetical scenarios given to them. They are often used by large organisations to predict behavioural tendencies and knowledge instruction of applicants. This particular test presented hypothetical scenarios within the work place where a tough desicion was to be made. The test-taker is then presented with a variety of possible actions and must rank them from most-likely response to least-likely response.

## Learning Style test

The Learning Style test involves a series of questions regarding preferences when doing daily activities e.g. Would you rather have a read a passage yourself or have it narrated to you? From these questions, it attempts to conclude whether you focus on one of the three learning types more than the others.

These three learning types are: Auditory, Visual and Tactile.
